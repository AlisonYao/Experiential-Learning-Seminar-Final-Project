NODEP-UA 9982.SY1 Experiential Learning Seminar | Final Project

## Project Description

This is a social science project with a tiny Data Science (NLP) element. 

### Data
All data is collection from the public domain. They are mostly trancripts from YouTube and also some blog posts and Quora Q&A.

### Qualitative

I mainly conducted qualitative research using interviews and digital ethnography.

### Quantitative

I also did a little bit of quantitative research by examining the word frequency on all the text corpus. The results support my theories in qualitative research.

-- transcriptConverter.py is used to clean up the format of YouTube transcript after copy pasteing.

-- wordFrequency.py is used to count the frequency of words after some basic data cleaning. Packages used: nltk, matplotlib.

I will showcase here the code and the majority of data I used for analysis.
