Real Talk with Reddit Data Scientist
00:00 And then I got to apply it to some
00:01 really fun stuff when I was like testing
00:03 the metric out like I got to answer
00:04 definitively do people care more about
00:06 dogs or cats.
00:11 Hey I'm Eliza from Springboard. I'm here
00:13 with Katie a senior data scientist at
00:15 reddit. Thank you so much for being here.
00:17 Thanks for having me. How did you become
00:19 a founding data scientist at Reddit?
00:21 Take us through your journey. The story
00:23 is probably not super exciting. I
00:26 mean it could be. But I had been working
00:29 as a data scientist in EdTech for a
00:30 while and a recruiter reached out to me.
00:32 I interviewed I actually interviewed for
00:35 a different position and I ended up
00:36 getting I was originally gonna be
00:38 working on like trust and safety type
00:39 stuff but then ended up moving on into a
00:42 more consumer product role and been
00:45 there ever since.
00:46 When I started we had all of our data in
00:49 hive, which if you've ever worked with
00:51 the hive database, it's it feels old. You
00:55 run a query and it takes three hours. And
00:58 after three hours, you might have like
00:59 spelled something wrong and you get
01:00 nothing back. So like that that was
01:03 something that when I first started felt
01:05 like a major challenge, but we pretty
01:06 quickly started migrating all of our
01:08 data into the Google cloud ecosystem. And
01:11 like that was a big challenge in and of
01:12 itself, but like once we got there we had
01:14 to start building our actual analytics
01:16 infrastructure. So there was a lot of
01:18 like putting stuff into ETL, figuring out
01:20 what are the business questions people
01:21 actually care about. The process of doing
01:23 that revealed like data quality problems
01:25 that we had that then resolved or figure
01:27 out how to like smooth over that and
01:28 make data easy to use. And then there's
01:31 also just a lot of like coaching people
01:33 and being able to think well with data.
01:35 It's it's definitely not intuitive. If
01:38 you've ever studied statistics, there's
01:41 so many like mental optical illusions I
01:45 guess that doesn't really you know like
01:46 the right way to describe a purely
01:49 mental thing, but like it's really easy
01:50 to have your intuition hijacked and to
01:55 think you know something and then find
01:57 out in the data that you don't. So there
01:59 was just a lot of work around getting
02:01 people to think data well and it's
02:04 something that we still do today and
02:05 probably will always have to do cuz
02:07 that's just what the life of a data
02:08 scientist is. Yeah it's a lot of
02:10 troubleshooting I imagine.
02:11 There's always something. What's been one
02:15 of the coolest projects that you've
02:16 worked on? I've gotten to do a lot of
02:18 really interesting stuff. I've touched
02:21 most parts of the product at this point,
02:22 but probably one of the most notable
02:24 ones was something that I did right when
02:25 I first got to Reddit, which was build
02:27 our time on site metric. That's a pretty
02:29 foundational metric in web analytics, so
02:32 it's a very high impact high profile
02:33 thing to get to work on and it was very
02:36 challenging the actual methodology
02:38 we used was pretty simple, but there was
02:41 a lot of edge cases, a lot of things that
02:43 as we dug deeper into the problem, we
02:45 found out like it's actually really hard
02:47 to figure out. When something happened in
02:49 a distributed system, which timestamps
02:52 do you trust? What do you do
02:54 when something an event like gets
02:57 through your pipeline like four days
02:59 after it's supposed to and it looks like
03:02 your session lasted four days. Like
03:04 that's probably not a human thing but
03:07 you have to figure it out somehow.
03:09 So it was a really interesting challenge
03:11 just in terms of like figuring out what
03:14 were all the boundaries and edge cases.
03:15 And then I got to apply it to some
03:17 really fun stuff when I was like testing
03:19 the metric out like I got to answer it
03:20 definitively do people care more about
03:22 dogs or cats. What was the
03:25 answer? Cats. Hurts me a little bit as a
03:27 dog lover myself, but I also I can I
03:30 controlled four different types of
03:31 animals subreddits and what's wrong with
03:34 your dog was far higher in time on sight
03:36 than what's wrong with your cat. So maybe
03:38 people are just worried about their dogs
03:39 malfunctioning. I don't know. Cats are
03:41 all individualistic. They don't need us
03:43 anyway so that's true.
03:44 Dogs have friends. Cats have staff. So what
03:51 are some data scientists specializations
03:53 and how do they differ? That's a very
03:56 good question to ask. Data science is
03:58 it's a newer profession. It's definitely
04:01 come a long way in terms of like people
04:03 have a pretty good idea of like what the
04:05 skill set of data scientist is and like
04:06 data science job description they're way
04:08 less insane than they used to be even a
04:10 couple years ago. But again like it means
04:13 different things in different places.
04:14 Sometimes the data scientist is more of
04:16 like a turbocharged analyst like they're
04:19 doing a lot of like very just ad hoc
04:21 analysis but like with sophisticated
04:23 methodology. So they might be like
04:25 modeling the like data generating
04:27 process of some like retention metric or
04:30 something. Or they might be like doing
04:33 like really gnarly A/B testing analysis.
04:36 I would consider that kind of like a
04:37 decision science I guess
04:39 specialization for data science. That's
04:42 that's one of the major ones I would say.
04:44 And then there's also people who are
04:46 really what I think is starting to get
04:49 called machine learning engineers. And
04:51 that's a lot of like you're putting a
04:53 system into productions like that's very
04:55 engineering heavy data science work and
04:57 it might involve actual modeling. It
05:01 might not. It might be like you're more
05:03 of like someone who's building in for a
05:05 bit like you need to know how the models
05:06 work to make sure you're implementing it
05:08 correctly. And yeah those are those are
05:12 probably the two main ones that I see,
05:14 but then there's also data scientists
05:17 who are kind of generalists. There are
05:19 data scientists who really are sort of
05:21 like lightweight data engineers like
05:23 mostly doing like ETL. It really varies a
05:25 lot. Would you consider yourself to be
05:28 more a generalist or a specialist? Am I
05:30 hurt I want to say a generalist. They're
05:32 definitely like some areas where I've
05:33 gone pretty deep I know a lot about
05:35 natural language processing. For example,
05:37 I wouldn't necessarily say I'm like a
05:39 natural language processing specialist,
05:40 though I definitely see myself as more
05:42 of a generalist. You currently manage the
05:44 data science internship at reddit.
05:46 Can you tell me a little bit more about
05:48 that? So the first time we did it was
05:49 last year. It was in partnership with
05:51 the University of San Francisco master's
05:53 of data science program and it was
05:56 really cool. We got to interview the
05:59 candidates. We got to spend several
06:03 months with them. It was really more of a
06:04 fellowship, so we had them from I think
06:07 October to May of this year so it was a
06:11 very very long project to work with them
06:14 for all that time. And it was an
06:18 interesting experience in just like
06:19 making a company a hospitable place for
06:21 a junior employee. A lot of companies
06:25 they they hire senior people not because
06:27 they have senior problems but because
06:29 they can't or maybe don't have time to
06:32 create structure to allow a junior
06:35 person who maybe doesn't really end
06:37 and how to negotiate like requirements
06:39 or deadlines. They can't
06:41 make that easy so they hire senior
06:44 people who know how to do even if the
06:46 work is not for senior people. So having
06:48 an internship program is
06:50 very much oriented around cultivating
06:53 that type of environment so when you
06:55 actually have interns with you. You spend
06:59 time like clearing obstacles for them
07:01 like making sure like they can just do
07:02 their work. Communicating for them like
07:05 telling people what they're doing so
07:07 like they might be able to help them or
07:08 pick up their work and use it. And when
07:10 they're not there and sort of the
07:12 offseason it's about like finding
07:13 projects that you can curate into intern
07:16 acceptable projects, so finding things
07:18 that are high impact or at least like
07:21 medium impact but also like not so hard
07:24 that like someone who is not super
07:25 experienced can't do or also like if it
07:29 doesn't get done like it won't be the
07:32 end of the world. It's like a very hard
07:34 balance to strike but making sure to
07:35 keep your eyes peeled for projects like
07:37 that makes a company a great place for
07:39 interns and junior employees more
07:41 generally. I think a lot of data
07:43 scientists end up with grad degrees and
07:46 I was wondering what's been your
07:48 experience with a bachelor's degree? how
07:50 did you break into the industry? I've
07:51 often joked that the most direct career
07:54 path into data science is being a jaded
07:56 physics PhD. I don't think that'll be the
07:59 case forever especially because a lot of
08:00 colleges are starting to have undergrad
08:02 degrees for a data science so this might
08:04 not even be true for people in the
08:06 future.
08:07 But for me, breaking in I think it took
08:10 a little bit of convincing. I had been an
08:13 analyst previously so like I certainly
08:15 had like relevant skills and like I
08:17 studied a quantitative social science in
08:21 school, so like I know the stats stuff.
08:23 But there's just something about
08:24 credentials that I think a lot of people
08:26 they trust. It's just like a filter that
08:30 they can use, so I had to be very
08:32 aggressive in my applications. I would
08:35 apply for things that it's like I don't
08:36 even know if I'm qualified for this. I
08:38 don't even know if I want to do this. But
08:40 I will see what happens by applying
08:43 and like I would have recruiters reach
08:45 out with like other analyst positions
08:47 and I'd be like I'm overqualified for
08:48 that I want to go to a data science position
08:50 and eventually it worked. It took
08:53 a lot of persistence and I was
08:55 frustrated a lot, but eventually I got
08:58 someone to give me a shot and now that
09:00 I've been a data scientist like it
09:02 doesn't matter. The work experience
09:04 matters a lot more than a background in
09:08 any particular field. I think that's true
09:10 really for any job in tech. People want
09:12 to know if you can do the job. What is
09:15 some advice that you would give to
09:16 someone aspiring to be a data scientist?
09:19 I would say that it is a job that will
09:25 always make you learn and that can be
09:28 both good and bad.
09:29 Sometimes it's exhausting where it's
09:30 like there's a new technology I have to
09:32 learn like man I have to like learn the
09:34 architecture of BERT now. I just learned
09:36 what an LSTM was. There's so many new
09:38 things constantly changing that might
09:40 slow down eventually, but right now the
09:42 field is so new and it's growing so fast
09:43 that it's like it feels like you can
09:45 never learn enough. And like as a part of
09:49 like be prepared to always learn new
09:51 things like first of all like learn
09:53 things you're excited about because
09:55 you'll want to do it. And that'll make
09:57 work pleasant if you're digging in deep
10:00 to something that you already care about.
10:01 But also like don't stress about knowing
10:05 everything because it's impossible and
10:08 technologies and techniques and
10:10 frameworks they all pop in and out of
10:13 existence all the time. Like you could go
10:14 super deep on something and then it
10:16 would just get deprecated so like focus
10:18 on what you're interested in what you
10:20 need to know for your job. What do you do
10:21 for fun in your free time? I really like
10:24 baking. I make a mean loaf of sourdough
10:27 bread and I'm currently doing a great
10:30 British Bake Off bake along challenge
10:31 with some different people. And I usually
10:34 do not win on aesthetics but my flavors
10:37 are pretty good so I'll take it.
10:38 Have you had like a what is it's like a
10:40 sourdough starter right that you have
10:42 have you had it going for a while? My
10:45 sourdough starter is four years old. Oh
10:47 it's like going off to kindergarten. Yeah maybe I
10:52 don't know. Maybe it's precocious. It's
10:55 made some good loaves of bread. What do
11:00 you want to learn next either in your
11:02 career or
11:03 just in life? Something that I really
11:05 want to do is strategy for for data
11:09 science and machine learning. How people
11:12 figure out like what's the business
11:13 model what makes sense for what we're
11:14 doing here.
11:15 And how can we align it with like the
11:18 people who are actually working on it so
11:20 that like they feel enthusiastic to do
11:22 it. So you just said you were on vacation.
11:24 Where do you want to travel to next? I
11:27 would love to do a road trip across the
11:29 US. I did it when I was a super little
11:32 kid so I don't really remember it and I
11:34 feel like I would feel really
11:35 differently about it now so I'm just
11:37 drive across the US. Like dude the
11:39 national parks are just kind of all over
11:41 the place I mean it would definitely be
11:43 better like if I could step off
11:44 everything. Just like I need to go across
11:46 the US in seven days. No yeah no I
11:49 would I would love to visit national
11:51 parks. I love being outdoors and hiking
11:53 and just seeing all the different things
11:55 that are out in the world so. Thanks yeah.
11:58 The last question what is your favorite
12:00 motto? Never attribute to malice what can
12:03 be attributed to incompetence, which
12:07 maybe seems a little dark but no I
12:10 usually I feel like people are not
12:11 actually trying to screw you over they
12:13 just like kind of forgot what they were
12:15 doing or weren't paying attention or
12:17 something if you just talk through
12:19 misunderstandings, usually you can
12:20 resolve them. So I think that's all the
12:22 time that we have for today. Thank you so
12:24 much for coming in and telling us all
12:25 about your data science experience. Yeah
12:27 thank you. It's been super fun.
