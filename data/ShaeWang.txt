Real Talk with Uber Data Scientist
00:00 Bikes and scooters are really fun. First
00:02 of all, it's a brand new product to just
00:05 not us, but also to the world. Hey there,
00:12 I'm Molly from Springboard and I'm here
00:14 with Shae a data scientist at Uber. Shae
00:16 thanks so much for being here today.
00:17 Thanks for having me. So let's start from
00:20 the beginning. How did you become a data
00:21 scientist to Uber? In college I studied
00:24 statistics and then computer science and
00:27 after I graduated, I knew I wanted to be
00:29 a data scientist somewhere.
00:30 Uber was my top choice because I used
00:33 the product a lot and I felt like I had
00:35 a really good understanding of what it's
00:37 like to be a customer. And number two I
00:40 just was always intrigued by the product
00:42 itself.
00:42 I loved sometimes seeing the cars little
00:45 cars move around and when you booked a
00:47 ride they're always so so on point with
00:49 you know the ETA and with the amount
00:52 charged. And everything was just working
00:54 so smoothly and I wanted to know what
00:56 was the mechanics behind it and I felt
00:58 like joining the company would help me
00:59 get there. So within Uber what teams do
01:02 you work on? Right now I'm working on the
01:04 bikes and scooters team and previously I
01:06 was on driver.
01:06 Oh cool! How do they differ? The biggest
01:09 difference between the two teams is that
01:11 on bikes and scooters, we not only have
01:13 mobile data, but bikes of scooters all
01:15 have hardware on there that capture a
01:19 lot of IOT device like data a lot of
01:22 firmware data. All of these different
01:24 data could add another dimension to how
01:27 you can understand the users' journey.
01:28 When they're actually on the scooter or
01:30 bike, what exactly is their experience.
01:32 Because the entire scooters and bikes
01:34 experience extends from booking it and
01:38 the entire trip and ending it and then
01:40 reusing it and being able to
01:42 consistently find it on the street.
01:43 What's it like working with bikes and
01:46 scooters? Bikes and scooters are really
01:48 fun. First of all, it's a brand new
01:51 product to just not us, but also to the
01:54 world. And I would say that you have to
01:58 deal with data from a lot of different
02:00 sources. For example, right now it's
02:02 you're not just dealing with customer
02:04 data anymore. You're looking at an IOT
02:06 device and you're looking at mobile. And
02:08 you're looking at the you have to use
02:10 all this data to tie together
02:11 users journey from where they're trying
02:14 to go somewhere and they're trying to
02:16 find a way to get there. And they're
02:18 choosing to use this product and then
02:20 the entire on trip experience till
02:22 afterwards and how do you repeatedly
02:24 engage them. You have to synthesize an
02:27 understanding of what is actually
02:28 happening to a user and what do they
02:30 really want out of your product. So
02:33 that's a really challenging part is
02:35 combining these different types of data
02:37 together. What are some exciting data
02:39 principles that you're able to apply
02:40 every day at work? I think the most
02:42 exciting part is when you run
02:44 experiments sometimes you run into
02:47 network effects. Sometimes you run into
02:49 cannibalization and you have to think of
02:51 creative ways to address these problems
02:52 while keeping your experiment results
02:54 very robust. One example is say you want
02:57 to run promotions on a set of bikes and
03:00 scooters for a certain area and you want
03:04 to see if that increases how many trips
03:06 people are actually taking. Now by
03:08 applying the promotion, you take away
03:11 more supply for from the control group
03:15 if the treatment group actually do end
03:17 up taking more bikes and scooters which
03:19 might lower your conversion rate for
03:21 your control group. Basically how do you
03:23 make sure that your environmental
03:24 controls are actually controlled. What
03:27 excites you about working with data
03:28 science everyday? I think the most
03:30 exciting part about being a data
03:31 scientist is being able to derive
03:34 insights and make decisions from
03:37 incomplete information. Every day you are
03:39 making decisions and you never know if
03:42 they're right or wrong. And you never
03:44 have complete information. But data
03:46 science actually quantifies that sort of
03:48 uncertainty and I think it's a very
03:50 empowering experience to be able to help
03:52 businesses make decisions and move
03:54 forward, even when they have incomplete
03:56 information. And then in contrast but
03:58 something that you might not like as
03:59 much about being a data scientist? I
04:01 think one thing that all data scientist
04:03 hate the most is messy data that they
04:06 have to clean up and somehow debug. I
04:09 encounter this in my day to day work and
04:11 you have to write a lot of sequels and a
04:13 lot of that piece of the job is
04:16 unavoidable but I think it's also nice
04:18 to always see that as an opportunity to
04:21 improve the platform and infra. It's a
04:25 good opportunity for people to say hey
04:26 maybe I want to contribute a piece of
04:28 open-source code to write something that
04:30 could help make other people's lives
04:32 easier or suggest something to your
04:34 company to build internal tools or even
04:36 build it yourself. So would you mind
04:38 speaking to your experience first being
04:41 in a formal educational setting and then
04:43 immediately going into the workforce?
04:44 What was that like and do you have any
04:46 advice for people who want to have a
04:47 similar career path as you? I think it
04:49 was very exciting and overwhelming at
04:51 the same time. The things you learn in
04:53 school are all printed on a textbook and
04:56 a lot of times they're outdated sort of
04:58 old material. And in the workforce you
05:01 realize that people are using new
05:02 methods. They're using experimental
05:04 methods and people are constantly on top
05:07 of new papers that are published.
05:08 Especially in the world of data science
05:10 where new algorithms are developed every
05:12 year at conferences, I think one
05:15 piece of advice I would have is to stay
05:17 on top of news and stay informed, go to
05:20 conferences, meet people because data
05:23 science is not a super mature field
05:25 and there's always opportunities for
05:27 improvement. You should never be afraid
05:28 to try new algorithms yourself or even
05:31 try to develop a new method. Cool!
05:33 What's your favorite podcast? My favorite
05:36 podcast is Seneca it's actually a
05:40 podcast that describes present-day
05:42 Chinese politics and economics and
05:46 everything about China that you need to
05:48 know. I like to stay informed since I
05:51 left China when I was 14 so it's a good
05:54 way to learn about how the macro is
05:56 going in my home country. If you could
05:58 travel back in time, what decade or
06:00 period of time would you go back to? If I
06:02 could also choose where I can be, then I
06:06 would say that I want to travel back in
06:08 time to work with Alan Turing. Love the
06:12 movie imitation game. I think that was a
06:14 main game changer for me in college when
06:17 I was trying to decide what I wanted to
06:18 do. Well I think that's all we have for
06:20 today. Thanks so much for joining us
06:21 Thanks for having me.
