Real Talk with Facebook Data Scientist
00:00 I think the whole league is starting to
00:02 understand that data science is super
00:03 crucial to performing well in basketball
00:05 and as a result, I think almost every NBA
00:09 team has their own data scientist trying
00:11 to help them out.
00:15 Hi, I'm Henry from Springboard and I'm here
00:18 today with Jeevan, a data scientist
00:20 at Facebook. Thanks so much for joining.
00:22 Thanks for having me.
00:24 So first question is how did you become
00:26 a data scientist? Can you take us through
00:28 your journey? I never actually planned on
00:31 becoming a data scientist I went into
00:34 college wanting to do Pre-med and I
00:37 actually ended up changing my major
00:38 three or four times. And as I was just
00:41 exploring classes and taking classes I
00:43 thought were interesting, I ended up
00:45 taking an intro data science class. And I
00:48 just found that that class was so much
00:50 more engaging than the other things I
00:52 was taking. And so from then on, I was
00:54 just trying to take more and more data
00:56 science classes and as I got more
00:58 interested in there, I started looking
00:59 for jobs and I ended up getting an
01:01 internship. And then after having like a
01:04 summer of doing that work was when I
01:05 really realized this was something I
01:06 want to pursue. Nice. And what
01:09 specifically did you like about data
01:10 science? I really liked that in data
01:13 science were like we make a hypothesis
01:15 with some prior knowledge. We try to
01:18 assess how can we test this hypothesis,
01:22 what data can be used, what methods can we
01:24 used. And then even after making all
01:26 those plans, once you start things change
01:29 and just very reactive and it's just an
01:31 exciting process start to end. And what
01:34 was some of the interesting problems
01:35 that you were able to solve? Whether through
01:38 class or at your internship? One of the
01:40 products I did in a summer internship,
01:43 that's Sonos, which is a smart speaker
01:45 company, was trying to predict if
01:47 customers would buy a second pair of
01:49 speakers after purchasing their first. So
01:51 we were able to look at things like does
01:54 the customer have like a premium music
01:57 streaming service like Spotify or or
01:59 SoundCloud. And if they did, they were
02:01 just much more likely to buy it. And we
02:03 use that to help better market the
02:05 speakers. And does Facebook have a
02:07 program for undergrads doing data
02:10 science? Yeah,Facebook actually hires a
02:12 lot of undergrad data
02:13 scientists. Super interesting because
02:15 most of the data scientists that we've
02:17 spoken with have graduate school
02:20 degrees. How does that work for someone
02:22 with a bachelor's degree? I think the
02:25 trend that data scientists need a
02:27 graduate degree is starting to slowly
02:28 die down and the reason is that
02:30 undergrad programs are starting to offer
02:32 data science classes. In the past, they
02:36 weren't as prevalent and so people who
02:37 needed to go to grad school to learn
02:39 these skills, but now you can learn
02:40 everything you need in undergrad and
02:42 with like so many free online tools as
02:45 well. So I feel like data science is like
02:47 not a career just for graduate students
02:49 anymore. What kind of classes do you take
02:52 as a data science major? As a data
02:54 science major, most of the classes you'll
02:56 take are in computer science and
02:57 statistics. But we also have this thing
03:00 called the domain emphasis, where you
03:02 just pick some other field that you're
03:04 really interested in, say biology or
03:06 psychology or economics, and you take
03:08 classes and those too with the hope that
03:10 you take your data science knowledge and
03:12 apply them in these fields. After you did
03:14 your internship at Facebook, you returned
03:17 for senior year and then went back to
03:19 Facebook what was that process like? Was
03:21 it pretty smooth? Or did you have to
03:23 interview again? No the process was
03:25 smooth. We got our return offers at the
03:28 very end of our internship so over my
03:31 senior year I didn't really have to
03:32 worry about recruiting or anything. I was
03:34 just like able to take classes I liked.
03:36 Now that you're at Facebook, what are you
03:38 working on now? My team at Facebook is
03:40 called Auction & Delivery. We're very a
03:42 cross-functional team. We work with a lot
03:44 of people in sales and business on ads.
03:47 We work with teams all across Facebook
03:49 and marketing, business, sales to maximize
03:54 the value that users and advertisers
03:55 both get on the platform. In terms of the
03:58 day to day work, what do you enjoy the
04:00 most about data science? Day-to-day
04:03 something I really like is that data
04:05 science isn't something you do by
04:07 yourself. I'm constantly working with
04:09 other data scientists on the team to get
04:10 their perspectives or people in other
04:12 departments that aren't data scientists
04:14 at all because they influence how we
04:16 think about problems and how we might go
04:18 about solving them a lot. So it's very
04:20 collaborative and I think that makes it
04:22 really fun.
04:23 On the flip side, what would you say is
04:25 the most challenging? A lot of projects
04:27 you take on in data science aren't very
04:29 well scoped. So you might take on a
04:32 project that has like a 20 percent
04:33 chance of success and you don't know is
04:36 this even possible to solve until you've
04:38 already spent so much time on it. But on
04:41 the flip side, that's also like it's it's
04:43 pretty exciting to just like be on your
04:45 toes and try to adapt as the problem
04:47 evolves. When you're working on these
04:49 problems, how long are these projects
04:51 usually before you realize maybe it's
04:54 not worth continuing? I think that can
04:56 vary a lot depending on how you want to
04:59 like plan your projects out. Some stuff I
05:02 worked on lasted weeks, months and I know
05:05 of projects that have lasted years. What
05:07 advice or tips would you have for
05:10 someone who is currently in college that
05:12 who wants to become a data scientist but
05:15 don't have the data science major to
05:18 pursue? If you're new to data science and
05:21 looking to add some stuff to your resume,
05:24 I think Kaggle is a great tool you can
05:26 go on and make your own little notebook.
05:29 You don't have to do a machine learning
05:31 problem although those are there.
05:32 You can just do exploratory analysis
05:34 on their datasets and they have so many
05:37 datasets that you can find something
05:39 that like you have some domain knowledge
05:40 and you're interested in. And then from
05:43 there, you know, make a couple notebooks,
05:44 put it on your resume, try to
05:47 showcase different techniques in them.
05:48 One great thing you can do is look at,
05:50 for a particular job you're applying for,
05:52 if they want say they really are
05:56 interested in exploratory analysis then
05:59 you can go use that skill in a Kaggle
06:01 dataset and then put that on your
06:03 resume and then just like match the
06:05 skills that you can do with what they're
06:07 looking for. In terms of your personal
06:09 growth, what do you see yourself running
06:12 next? I think a lot of new data
06:16 scientists are sort of given a project
06:19 and expect you to execute and the next
06:22 big step to take is figuring out how to
06:24 scope your own projects, figuring out
06:26 what areas, what problems, can we solve
06:29 with data science. I think a great way to
06:31 improve on that is
06:34 you look at the projects that are going
06:36 on and try to talk to the people who
06:38 came up with it and get through their
06:41 thought process. According to your
06:42 LinkedIn profile, it seems like you
06:44 play basketball right? Yeah, I do.
06:47 Can you hypothetically use data science
06:49 to be a better individual basketball
06:52 player or help a team won more games?
06:55 Yeah absolutely. I think the whole league
06:58 is starting to understand that data
06:59 science is super crucial to performing
07:01 well in basketball and as a result, I
07:04 think almost every NBA team has their
07:06 own data scientists trying to help now I
07:09 actually have friends that were data
07:11 science students at Cal and they went on
07:13 to become data scientist for NBA teams.
07:15 And they helped them out with you know
07:17 picking the most efficient plays, trying
07:20 to value players properly. Who was like
07:23 the pioneer in basketball analytics?
07:26 I think the pioneer basketball analytics
07:29 is Daryl Morey. So there's actually a
07:31 term coined after the pioneer of
07:33 basketball analytics called
07:35 Morey ball, which is a Daryl Morey's
07:37 method of playing basketball and he had
07:40 the Houston Rockets shooting
07:41 three-pointers just way before everyone
07:44 else valued them and soon after they
07:46 noticed how effective it was, just a shot
07:49 with the better expected value each play,
07:51 all the other teams started joining
07:53 along. And now you see that data science
07:55 has changed the entire landscape of the
07:57 league. Now his teams are moving so much
07:59 towards the three-pointer and the open
08:01 layup and you don't see teams taking
08:03 long tubes anymore. There have been
08:04 stories in practice where a long tube is
08:06 actually like negative points because
08:08 it's just such a poor efficiency play.
08:10 That's the way data science has
08:11 influenced the game so much. So I had a
08:13 friend who was a data scientist on the
08:15 Brooklyn Nets and part of his work was
08:18 trying to figure out a way to value
08:21 their players and compare that to how
08:23 the players are evaluated in the free
08:25 agency market. You know if there's some
08:27 discrepancy there. If you value a player
08:30 less than the market values them, then
08:32 you can get positive assets from that. In
08:34 today's NBA, if the player wants to
08:37 maximize that value, what kind of skills
08:39 should they be working on?
08:42 that's actually an interesting question
08:43 because the best player right now
08:47 doesn't necessarily mean they perform
08:50 the best on how we evaluate players
08:53 right now. Because one thing is it's very
08:55 hard to measure how well a player is
08:57 defensively. One really important metric
08:59 to evaluate your best player is their
09:01 true shooting percentage. It's an
09:03 advance that became a lot more popular
09:05 recently as players started shooting
09:06 more free throws and three-pointers
09:08 because those are so much more valuable
09:10 than a regular two-point shot. What's
09:13 your favorite team right now? My favorite
09:15 team is the Houston Rockets. Why do you
09:17 think Carmelo Anthony is out of the league?
09:20 I think Melo is out because he doesn't
09:24 have his hoodie on. And if he puts that
09:26 on, he'll be back in MVP status. I think
09:28 Carmelo Anthony is sort of a great
09:32 player in the old league where we really
09:35 did value those two-point shots a lot
09:36 but now as we found out three points and
09:39 free throws are so much more valuable he
09:41 just doesn't have the efficiency that a
09:43 lot of other players bring. And last
09:45 question is what is your life motto? I
09:48 think a motto that's been really
09:50 important in my life so far is just to
09:53 not fear failure. You need to be able to
09:56 like take on some bigger project that
09:59 like there might be a high chance of you
10:01 not not accomplishing it, but that you
10:05 can't let that stop you and you just
10:06 have to go for it anyway. Awesome that's
10:08 great advice. Cool thank you so much for
10:11 sharing your experience about data
10:14 science. Thanks
