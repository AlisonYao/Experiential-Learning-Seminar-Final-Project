Data Science: Startup vs. Large Corporation
00:00 Hello everyone, Ken here. Today I'm
00:02 talking about the differences in the
00:04 data science role at a start-up versus a
00:08 large corporation. I've worked as a data
00:10 scientist and a data scientist manager
00:12 at both startups and fortune 100
00:14 organizations and there's some pretty
00:16 stark differences between the working
00:18 experience in this role. Before I get
00:21 into the meat here, I'm gonna please
00:22 remind you to like this video if you
00:24 enjoy it really helps me spread and grow
00:27 my channel. Also subscribe if you'd like
00:29 to see more content like this. Now the
00:31 first thing I'd like to talk about is
00:33 the actual nature of the data science
00:35 role. In smaller startups, usually data
00:38 scientists are responsible for a lot
00:41 more breadth in terms of activities. So
00:44 you're maybe not going to be doing data
00:45 science all the time. You could be
00:46 helping with even marketing strategy or
00:49 designing the infrastructure of the
00:51 databases there's a lot of things you
00:54 can do a lot of ways that you can pitch
00:55 in. And this is really great experience
00:57 especially if you want to be moving into
01:00 management or managing of other parts of
01:03 the organization aside from data science
01:05 down the road. It's still a great place
01:07 to learn data science because you
01:09 understand the strategy of why you're setting
01:11 up certain analyses and why a certain
01:15 project fits into the bigger picture of
01:17 the company. In large organizations, big
01:19 corporations, the role of the data
01:21 scientist is generally a lot more
01:23 defined you're probably going to work in
01:26 one fairly specific area with fairly
01:29 specific constraints. For example, when I
01:31 was at GE, one of the guys I worked with --
01:33 his whole responsibility was to work on
01:36 and improve the wheel wear
01:40 model for locomotives. So, no I mean that
01:44 was a cool job. He absolutely loved it,
01:46 but his focus was very very specific in
01:49 that area. If a lot of tasks, a lot of
01:53 projects can seem overwhelming to you, this
01:55 is totally a great option. You can
01:57 completely master one subject area and
01:59 that can be the focus of a large part of
02:02 your career. Culturally in a start-up,
02:04 things can happen very fast. You can be
02:07 working on one project. You get it to
02:09 where it's good enough and then you
02:11 start working on another one. You can
02:13 pivot in terms of your strategy and the
02:16 projects that you were working on before
02:18 aren't necessarily relevant anymore. And
02:20 that's something to be prepared for. If
02:22 you like that fast-paced atmosphere this
02:25 is absolutely something for you. On the
02:27 other hand, in large corporations, things can
02:30 generally happen a lot slower because of
02:33 structured corporate culture. There's
02:36 generally a hierarchy and things have to
02:38 get approved in order for them to
02:41 actually get done. So even to get access
02:44 to the data source, get preliminary
02:47 approval to have a dashboard built. This
02:50 has to go through some approval process
02:52 from the higher-ups. And that can be a
02:55 bit frustrating sometimes, but it also
02:57 means that you're gonna be working on
02:59 projects that are very carefully curated.
03:02 So from a data perspective, I think any
03:06 organization big or small can have data
03:08 quality issues. Usually larger
03:10 organizations struggle with data because
03:12 of legacy systems legacy things that
03:15 they've been collecting that don't
03:17 cooperate or integrate well with the new
03:19 data that they have that's very relevant
03:21 and useful. So if you are going to have a
03:25 wealth of data, but managing it can be a
03:27 bit difficult from a data science
03:29 perspective. On the other hand, at a
03:31 start-up usually there is not enough
03:35 data. You know there's some data
03:37 collected, but there's not enough time or the
03:40 function that you want to understand
03:42 better hasn't been around for long
03:43 enough for you to be able to use this
03:46 data in analysis. So there's two
03:48 different data challenges at these two
03:50 different levels and you kind of have to
03:52 figure out: one, this is very specific to
03:54 the organization so what your
03:56 organization and what the organization
03:57 that you're looking at is struggling
03:59 with and two, what type of challenge that
04:02 you like do you like working with sparse
04:03 data? Or do you like cleaning, cutting and
04:06 manipulating data so that it can be a
04:08 partial match and can be workable within
04:10 your algorithms. Overall, I personally
04:13 prefer working in the startup
04:15 environment better. I really love data
04:17 science, but I love other elements of
04:19 business as well.
04:20 I like management. I like communicating
04:22 with people. And I found that in a
04:24 start-up I had ownership of a lot more
04:27 things.
04:27 And I was able to really make an impact.
04:29 For me, seeing an impact in an
04:32 organization is extremely extremely
04:34 meaningful. Thank you so much for
04:37 watching and please enjoy your data
04:38 science journey.
